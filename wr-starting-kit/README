This project guides new users to start in the White Rabbit “World” with simple experiments. The starting kit uses two SPEC + FMC-DIO cards. Each node allows basic operations such as input timestamping or programmable output pulse generation. Additionally, specific software and gateware layers allow to use it as a standard network interface card implementing the White Rabbit technology functionalities.
