This project directory sbnddaq-readout/projects/wr/ encapsulates 
and buils the Seven Solutions / CERN White Rabbit starting kit, 
including the various device drivers and standard tools.

To make and install the device drivers and software, type:

setup gcc v7_3_0
unsetup python
make clean
make
ksu
make install

The latter requires ksudo access to the root account, as it installs 
the actual device drivers.  After these steps are complete, the 
drivers will be automatically reloaded after every reboot -- no need to 
run modprobe.   The SPEC tools executables are also installed in /usr/bin 
with the privilege bit set so they can be run from account other 
than root.

For status/enable/disable functions, use on of the three argumnents here:

/sbin/service spec [status|start|stop]

For your convenience, an RPM file is created during the make 
process if you wish to use this configuration mechanism.
